# Quantum-Data-Calculator

This is a webapp I built with a partner that served to make our lives easier in the quantum optics lab.

How to use:
1. clone the repo
2. run app.py
3. enter input for eigenvalues and desired output

To use density matrix calculator, insert "/density.html" after localhost ip address in search bar. 
For example if locally hosted on "127.0.0.1:5000" change it to "127.0.0.1:5000/density.html"
